My name is Chase Adams.

I have been a software engineer for over a decade and am currently fascinated by local-first software. A non-exhaustive list of organizations I've contributed to:

- [Transparency](https://filetransparency.com/) (founder)
- [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/) (engineer)
- [Zendoor](https://zendoor.com/) (founding engineer)
- [Lieuu](https://lieuu.com/) (founder)
- [The Luminosity Lab](https://theluminositylab.com/) (director)
- [WebPT](https://webpt.com/) (engineer)

I love to write useful software, explore new ideas, spend time with my family & friends & dogs, explore national parks, ski, run, and read.
